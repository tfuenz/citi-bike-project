# citi-bike-project

The objective of this assignment is to combine map making techniques from leaflet in order to map citi bike stations and their operational status.
This was achieved by using an api pull to retrieve trip data from the citibike website. The contents of Question1 consist of initially mapping the stations
as well as labeling with basic information. The contents of Question2 go more in depth by outlining more detailed information such as whether the station is low on bikes, out of order, or even mapping planned stations. Additionally, there are various layers that let the user search for the stations of a specified type with each unique station type being denoted with a different marker.
